# Obsidian Kanban Plugin

Create markdown-backed Kanban boards in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

## Custom Feature Additions

This custom version of the plugin has 2 new features:

#### Periods

If the 'Allow Period in Dates' setting is on, Kanban boards can render larger time periods such as weeks, months, quarters and years. This works along with the [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) plugin to allow for Kanban cards/items to be linked to daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly journals using the same date notation (@ by default). Note that this setting overrides the date and date display formats.

#### Lane Complete Markers

Comes prepackaged with this version of the plugin, Kanban lanes now have an extra setting that allows you to set a task complete marker per lane. The complete marker is the single character that goes in between the `[ ]` symbols whenever the respective card/item is placed in a given lane. This allows for different lanes to mark complete tasks differently (e.g. with the cancelled marker '-' or the reschedule marker '<'). This feature has not been tested with the show checkbox in card setting.
